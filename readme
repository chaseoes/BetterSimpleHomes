# BetterSimpleHomes

A lightweight and simple Bukkit plugin (a Minecraft server mod) that adds /home functionality. Well-developed and bug free.

## Commands
* **/sethome**: Set (or reset) your home location to where you're currently standing.
* **/home**: Teleport back to the home location you set using the previous command.

## Features
* **Lightweight.** Designed with simplicity in mind. The source is available on GitHub and is less than 120 lines.
* **Bug free.** It just works. No errors, no bugs, no unintended features. Extremely reliable to always get you to your home location.
* **Always works.** BetterSimpleHomes will almost never need to be updated and will continue to work with future Minecraft and Bukkit versions.

## Default Configuration
    home: "&cTeleporting to your home..."
    sethome: "&cSuccessfully set home location!"
    nohome: "&cYou haven't set a home! Please use /sethome first."
